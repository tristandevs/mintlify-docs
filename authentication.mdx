You may get a **FREE** ShuttleAI API key by performing the `/getkey` command in our [official discord server](https://discord.gg/shuttleai)!

All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:

> Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share your key with anyone!

<CodeGroup>

```javascript HTTP ShuttleAI API Auth
Authorization: Bearer SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY
```

```python Lib ShuttleAI API Auth
from shuttleai import *

"""Synchronous"""
shuttle = ShuttleClient("SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY")

# OR

"""Asynchronous"""
async with ShuttleAsyncClient("SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY") as shuttle:
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Remember! We recommend you to ALWAYS use the Asynchronous client over the Synchronous client.</Tip>
