You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY` with your secret API key from our [discord](https://discord.gg/shuttleai).

```bash
curl https://api.shuttleai.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-4",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7,
     "max_tokens": 5
   }'
```

This will call ShuttleAI's `gpt-4` model with certain kwargs set like `max_tokens` and `temperature`. Since we asked as a user to "Say this is a test!", we will receive a response similar to:
```json
{
    "choices": [
        {
            "finish_reason": "length",
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "content": "This is a test!",
                "role": "assistant"
            }
        }
    ],
    "created": 1707784511,
    "id": "chatcmpl-c18f90b794e8574ef85b8566b070ce55",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "system_fingerprint": "fp_1wzhx7ttnt",
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": 5,
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "total_tokens": 18
    }
}
```

You just made your first `ChatCompletion` request with ShuttleAI!

But, what does that mean?
Let's break down the response object; Since we inputted a `max_tokens` parameter set to 5, we can see in our usage that the `completion_tokens` does not and will not surpass our set value of 5. Additionally, we have a `finish_reason` field, since the `completion_tokens` reached the `max_tokens` set, we get a  "length" value, however, any of the strings listed below are applicable:
- "stop" (When the full output of the request has been delivered)
- "tool_calls" (When the response delivered uses a tool call)
- "length" (When `completion_tokens` meets or exceeds `max_tokens`)
