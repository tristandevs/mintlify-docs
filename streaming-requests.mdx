### ShuttleAI Streaming


The ShuttleAI API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the Server-sent events standard.

Our official [Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/shuttleai) handles Server-sent events for you. In Python, a streaming request looks like:

```python
import asyncio
from shuttleai import *

async def main():
    async with ShuttleAsyncClient($SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY, timeout=60) as shuttle:
         response = await shuttle.chat_completion(
             model="gpt-4",
             messages="write me a short story about bees",
             stream=True,
             plain=True
         )
         async for chunk in response:
             try:
                 print(chunk['choices'][0]['delta']['content'])
             except:
                 pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
    asyncio.run(main())
```
